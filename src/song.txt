Thousand miles by Vanessa Carlton

Makin' my way downtown
Walkin' fast
Faces pass
And I'm homebound

Starin' blankly ahead
Just makin' my way, makin' a way
Through the crowd

And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by?
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
Tonight

It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder, if you ever think of me?
'Cause everything's so wrong
And I don't belong
Livin' in your precious memory
